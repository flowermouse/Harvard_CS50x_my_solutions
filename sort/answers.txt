sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?:Because the Omega complexity of the selection sort is the highest, which consumed most time in the reversed sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?:the random running time equals to the sort1, but its reversed and sorted running time is less.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:the random running time is the lowest, and the reversed and sorted time almost the same as the random, because the algorithms is a Theta type.
